								<a href="http://www.nasaproracing.com/rules.htm"
									>http://www.nasaproracing.com/rules.htm</a
								>
								)
							</p>

							<p>These rules supersede the national rules if in conflict.</p>

							<p>SAFETY</p>

							<p>
								In order for our events to be safe, EVERYONE must help with
								safety by acting responsibly yourself, watching out for non
								waivered people on site and helping others.
							</p>

							<p>
								Our events operate with a safety steward and event chairman, who
								are the points of contact for any safety concerns.
							</p>

							<p>1. ENTRY FEES</p>

							<p>Entry fees are as follows:</p>

							<p>$35 for either the morning or afternoon session/event.</p>

							<p>$50 for both session/events.</p>

							</p>

							<p>
								For points championship events the course will be modified
								between the morning and afternoon session/events.  Typically,
								the course direction will be reversed, but GAX reserves the
								right to use other modifications.

								Entrants may enter the morning session/event, the afternoon
								session/event or both.

							<p>
								Our events will offer the following classes for competition:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										The regionally recognized classes in 2017 shall be NASA-X R,
										U, S, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H – as per the NASA-X National

										drivers who don’t want to be on the results.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										For class lettering, use “N” or “NX” followed by the class
										letter R, U, S, A, etc.   E.G. A car running NASA-X R would

										otherwise, or drivers who don’t want to be on the results.
										 This class is also to be used for the afternoon
										session/event runs if the entrant competed in the morning
										session/event.    You may use an “X” for your class marking.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>10. TECH INSPECTION AND FORMS</p>

							<p>
								NASA-X events require the driver of the vehicle certify, or have
								a shop certify, that all items have been inspected and meet the
								standards set forth.   When the driver signs the tech sheet,
								they are assuming full responsibility for the vehicles condition
								and usage at the event.
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>
										All drivers will receive a blank tech form at the waiver
										station or registration.  You may also download the sheet
										from
										<a
											href="https://nasa-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/document/document/337/nasa-x_tech.pdf"
											>https://nasa-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/document/document/337/nasa-x_tech.pdf</a
										>
										and fill it out ahead of time.   
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Every driver must nave their own form</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Place your completed and signed tech sheet on your
										windshield or other easily visible place and put your car in
										the appropriate grid.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Make sure your hood/engine cover and trunk is unlatched.
									</p>
								</li>

										approximately 15 minutes before the heat begins.    Please

										inspection
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The tech inspector will remove the tech sheet(s) of all cars
										that pass and apply a temporary sticker to indicate passage.
										  If the sheet is left on your car, it means there was an
										issue with your car.  The sheet will indicate the problem
										and find an even official to be re-teched.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p>
								Any vehicle receiving any repairs during the event must undergo
								another inspection before resuming competition.
							</p>

							<p>

								PRESENT A SAFE CAR FOR COMPETITION AT ALL TIMES.
							</p>

							<p>11. CAR NUMBERS AND CLASS LETTERING</p>

								each class.   Second drivers in the same car and class must use
								the original car number plus 100 (e.g. first driver is 45,
								second is 145)
							</p>

							<p>
								Numbers and class letters must be displayed on both sides of the
								vehicle at all times during competition.   Numbers should be
								approximately 8 inches tall and letters 4 inches, with adequate
								stroke.

								required to change them during the event.
							</p>

							<p>12.  NOVICES,  INSTRUCTORS AND ONE ON ONE NOVICE SCHOOL</p>

							<p>
								New entrants are encouraged to contact any NASA-X Central crew
								member for help with anything during the day.  A single

								safety steward.   No other cars will be on course while junior
								karts are running and depending on site layout, other areas of
								grid and or paddock may be designated “no cars running” or “no
								cars moving” zones.

							<p>21.  POINTS CHAMPIONSHIP</p>

							<p>
								In 2017, all St. Louis area Gateway AutoX events will be part of
								our Championship series with great trophies and prizes awarded
								for series champions.  Here are the details:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										Points are awarded to the top 10 positions from the overall
										index.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Morning and afternoon session/events of each event day are
										scored as separate points events, with the course being run
										in reversed direction for the afternoon session/event.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Points are awarded to all drivers in the event based on the
										percentage of the index winner’s time and the individual
										driver’s time. To determine the individual driver’s points,
										the winner’s time is divided by the individual driver’s time
										and multiplied by 10,000. All drivers are scored.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Example: Racer 1 wins his class with a time of 50.000
										seconds; Racer 2 finishes second, with a time of 51.500
										seconds; Racer 3 finishes with a time of 55.870 seconds.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Their points come out like this:</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Racer 1 automatically gets 10,000 points for winning</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Racer 2 receives 9709 points, (50.000/51.500) x 10,000</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Racer 3 receives 8949 points, (50.000/55.870) x 10,000</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>And so on down to 10th place</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										If a driver DNFs (Does Not Finish) all runs for a particular
										event, the class points awarded will be based on the slowest
										time in that class, plus four seconds. Should the only
										driver in a class DNF all runs, that driver will earn no
										class points for that event.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										There are 6 points events scheduled for 2017.   4 out of 6
										events count for points.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The Peru and Blytheville events do not count for points,
									</p>
								</li>
