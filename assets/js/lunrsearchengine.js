Morning and afternoon session/events of each event day are scored as separate points events, with the course being run in reversed direction for the afternoon session/event.     Points are awarded to all drivers in the event based on the percentage of the index winner’s time and the individual driver’s time. To determine the individual driver’s points, the winner’s time is divided by the individual driver’s time and multiplied by 10,000. All drivers are scored.     Example: Racer 1 wins his class with a time of 50. 000 seconds; Racer 2 finishes second, with a time of 51. 500 seconds; Racer 3 finishes with a time of 55. 870 seconds.     Their points come out like this:     Racer 1 automatically gets 10,000 points for winning     Racer 2 receives 9709 points, (50. 000/51. 500) x 10,000     Racer 3 receives 8949 points, (50. 000/55. 870) x 10,000     And so on down to 10th place     If a driver DNFs (Does Not Finish) all runs for a particular event, the class points awarded will be based on the slowest time in that class, plus four seconds. Should the only driver in a class DNF all runs, that driver will earn no class points for that event.     There are 6 points events scheduled for 2017.   4 out of 6 events count for points.     The Peru and Blytheville events do not count for points,  22.  POINT OF CONTACT Event Director - Carla Russo Region Director - Dave Whitworth [email protected] 23.
